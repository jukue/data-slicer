Introduction
============

The ``data_slicer`` package provides tools for the visualization of 3 
dimensional datasets.

Most notably it contains the Python Image Tool, PIT for short, a simple but 
fast GUI to efficiently look at 3D data, slice it in various ways and employ 
data processings from the command line of an ipython console. Thanks to 
support for plugins, your routines can be easily integrated into PIT.

Besides that, other widgets for 3D visualization are also available.
