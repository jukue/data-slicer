Contributing
============

Thank you for helping to make this software package more useful!
There are several ways in which you can contribute: giving feedback, 
reporting bugs, issuing feature requests or fixing bugs and adding new 
features yourself. 
Furthermore, you can create and share your own :ref:`plugins <sec-plugin>`.

Feedback, bugs and feature requests
-----------------------------------

The most straightforward and organized way to help improve this software is 
by opening an **issue** on `the github 
repository <https://github.com/kuadrat/data-slicer/issues>`.
To do this, navigate to the **Issues** tab and click **New issue**.
Please try to describe the bug you encountered or the new feature you would 
like to see as detailed as possible.
If you have several bugs/ideas please open a separate issue for each of them 
in order to keep the discussions focused.

If you have anything to tell me that does not seem to warrant opening an 
issue or you simply prefer to contact me directly you can do this via e-mail:
kevin.pasqual.kramer@protonmail.ch

Contributing code
-----------------

If you have fixed a bug or created a new feature in the source code yourself, 
it can be merged into this project.
Code contributions will be acknowledged in this README or, if the number of 
contributors grows too large, in a separate file.
If you are familiar with the workflow on github, please go ahead and create a 
pull request.
If you are unsure you can always contact me via e-mail (see above).

Plugins
-------

If you have created a PIT plugin, feel free to add it to the list on the 
:ref:`plugins page <sec-plugin>`, either via pull request or through an 
e-mail (see above).
