	Abstract = {Quantum magnets have occupied the fertile ground between many-body theory and low-temperature experiments on real materials since the early days of quantum mechanics. However, our understanding of even deceptively simple systems of interacting spin-1/2 particles is far from complete. The quantum square-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, for example, exhibits a striking anomaly of hitherto unknown origin in its magnetic excitation spectrum. This quantum effect manifests itself for excitations propagating with the specific wavevector (π, 0). We use polarized neutron spectroscopy to fully characterize the magnetic fluctuations in the metal-organic compound Cu(DCOO)2⋅4D2O, a known realization of the quantum square-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet model. Our experiments reveal an isotropic excitation continuum at the anomaly, which we analyse theoretically using Gutzwiller-projected trial wavefunctions. The excitation continuum is accounted for by the existence of spatially extended pairs of fractional S = 1/2 quasiparticles, 2D analogues of 1D spinons. Away from the anomalous wavevector, these fractional excitations are bound and form conventional magnons. Our results establish the existence of fractional quasiparticles in the high-energy spectrum of a quasi-two-dimensional antiferromagnet, even in the absence of frustration.},

	abstract = {It is well established that in the low-temperature limit, the two-dimensional quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice (2DQHAFSL) exhibits an anomaly in its spectrum at short-wavelengths on the zone-boundary. In the vicinity of the point the pole in the one-magnon response exhibits a downward dispersion, is heavily damped and attenuated, giving way to an isotropic continuum of excitations extending to high energies. The origin of the anomaly and the presence of the continuum are of current theoretical interest, with suggestions focused around the idea that the latter evidences the existence of spinons in a two-dimensional system. Here we present the results of neutron inelastic scattering experiments and Quantum Monte Carlo calculations on the metallo-organic compound Cu(DCOO)D2O (CFTD), an excellent physical realisation of the 2DQHAFSL, designed to investigate how the anomaly at evolves up to finite temperatures . Our data reveal that on warming the anomaly survives the loss of long-range, three-dimensional order, and that it is thus a robust feature of the two-dimensional system. With further increase of temperature the zone-boundary response gradually softens and broadens, washing out the anomaly. This is confirmed by a comparison of our data with the results of finite-temperature Quantum Monte Carlo simulations where the two are found to be in good accord. In the vicinity of the antiferromagnetic zone centre, there was no significant softening of the magnetic excitations over the range of temperatures investigated.}

Due to the high spherical symmetry, they are also well suited as imaging energy filters for electron microscopy. Here, we review the imaging properties of hemispherical deflection analyzers with emphasis on the application for cathode lens microscopy. In particular, it turns out that aberrations, in general limiting the image resolution, cancel out at the entrance and exit of the analyzer. This finding allows more compact imaging energy filters for momentum microscopy or photoelectron emission microscopy. For instance, high resolution imaging is possible, using only a single hemisphere. Conversely, a double pass hemispherical analyzer can double the energy dispersion, which means it can double the energy resolution at certain transmission, or can multiply the transmission at certain energy resolution."

SR-based characterization methods can be employed to analyze different systems such as powders, thin films, and bulk forms having complex crystalline or amorphous structures. In this review, peculiarities of SR are briefly explained. Moreover, various techniques carried out utilizing this instrument for material characterization such as X-ray powder diffraction, grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction, small/wide-angle X-ray scattering, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, different techniques of X-ray imaging, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray microprobes/nanoprobes are presented. As a result, by shedding light on the advantages of SR and its superiority to the equivalent laboratory experiments, researchers are recommended to exploit the capabilities of this invaluable tool in their materials characterization.},

abstract = {100kV is investigated as the operating voltage for single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM). Reducing the electron energy from the current standard of 300 or 200keV offers both cost savings and potentially improved imaging. The latter follows from recent measurements of radiation damage to biological specimens by high-energy electrons, which show that at lower energies there is an increased amount of information available per unit damage. For frozen hydrated specimens around 300{\AA} in thickness, the predicted optimal electron energy for imaging is 100keV. Currently available electron cryomicroscopes in the 100{--}120keV range are not optimized for cryoEM as they lack both the spatially coherent illumination needed for the high defocus used in cryoEM and imaging detectors optimized for 100keV electrons. To demonstrate the potential of imaging at 100kV, the voltage of a standard, commercial 200kV field-emission gun (FEG) microscope was reduced to 100kV and a side-entry cryoholder was used. As high-efficiency, large-area cameras are not currently available for 100keV electrons, a commercial hybrid pixel camera designed for X-ray detection was attached to the camera chamber and was used for low-dose data collection. Using this configuration, five single-particle specimens were imaged: hepatitis B virus capsid, bacterial 70S ribosome, catalase, DNA protection during starvation protein and haemoglobin, ranging in size from 4.5MDa to 64kDa with corresponding diameters from 320 to 72{\AA}. These five data sets were used to reconstruct 3D structures with resolutions between 8.4 and 3.4{\AA}. Based on this work, the practical advantages and current technological limitations to single-particle cryoEM at 100keV are considered. These results are also discussed in the context of future microscope development towards the goal of rapid, simple and widely available structure determination of any purified biological specimen.},

The new EIGER detector features a pixel size of 75 {$\times$} 75{$\mu$}m, frame rates of up to 3000Hz and a dead time as low as 3.8{$\mu$}s. An EIGER 1M and EIGER 16M were tested on Swiss Light Source beamlines X10SA and X06SA for their application in macromolecular crystallography. The combination of fast frame rates and a very short dead time allows high-quality data acquisition in a shorter time. The ultrafine {$\varphi$}-slicing data-collection method is introduced and validated and its application in finding the optimal rotation angle, a suitable rotation speed and a sufficient X-ray dose are presented. An improvement of the data quality up to slicing at one tenth of the mosaicity has been observed, which is much finer than expected based on previous findings. The influence of key data-collection parameters on data quality is discussed.},

A 3D dataset was created from the subsequent frames. The 3D x-ray diffraction (XRD3) pattern contains far more information than a one-dimensional profile collected with the conventional diffractometer and 2D x-ray diffraction (XRD2). The present work discusses some fundamentals about XRD3, such as the data collection method, 3D visualization, diffraction data interpretation and potential applications of XRD3.}
